Clinical Trial: Phase I Dose-Escalation Study of Novel Kinase Inhibitor XYZ-123 in Advanced Solid Tumors

Trial Design: Open-label, dose-escalation study using 3+3 design
Participants: 42 patients with refractory solid tumors
Dose Levels: 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 600 mg twice daily
Primary Endpoint: Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)

Dose-Limiting Toxicities:
- 400 mg BID: Grade 3 diarrhea (2/6 patients)
- 600 mg BID: Grade 3 hepatotoxicity (1/3), Grade 4 neutropenia (1/3)
- MTD established: 200 mg BID
- Recommended Phase II dose: 200 mg BID

Safety Profile:
- Most common AEs: diarrhea (76%), fatigue (67%), nausea (52%)
- Grade 3-4 events: hepatotoxicity (12%), neutropenia (10%), thrombocytopenia (7%)
- Hepatotoxicity pattern: Mixed hepatocellular-cholestatic injury
- Onset: Median 28 days (range 14-56 days)
- Reversibility: All hepatic events resolved within 4 weeks of discontinuation

Pharmacokinetics:
- Dose-proportional exposure up to 200 mg
- Non-linear kinetics at higher doses suggesting saturation
- Half-life: 8-12 hours supporting BID dosing
- Food effect: 40% increase in AUC with high-fat meal

Preliminary Efficacy:
- Stable disease ≥16 weeks: 24% of patients
- Partial response: 1 patient with BRAF-mutant melanoma
- Target engagement confirmed by pharmacodynamic biomarkers

Toxicology Insights:
- Hepatotoxicity likely related to mitochondrial dysfunction
- Neutropenia dose-dependent and reversible
- No evidence of cardiac toxicity or QT prolongation

Next Steps: Phase II expansion in selected tumor types at 200 mg BID with enhanced hepatic monitoring
