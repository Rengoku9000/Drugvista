Clinical Trial: Phase III Cardiovascular Outcomes Study of Semaglutide (SUSTAIN-6)

Trial Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcomes trial
Participants: 3,297 patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk
Primary Endpoint: Time to first occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)
Follow-up Duration: Median 2.1 years

Results Summary:
- Primary MACE endpoint: 6.6% (semaglutide) vs 8.9% (placebo)
- Hazard ratio: 0.74 (95% CI: 0.58-0.95, p=0.02 for superiority)
- Cardiovascular death: 2.7% vs 2.8% (HR 0.98)
- Non-fatal MI: 2.9% vs 3.9% (HR 0.74)
- Non-fatal stroke: 1.6% vs 2.7% (HR 0.61)

Glycemic Efficacy:
- HbA1c reduction: -1.4% vs -0.4% (placebo)
- Weight loss: -4.9 kg vs -1.0 kg (placebo)
- Systolic BP reduction: -3.4 mmHg vs -0.5 mmHg

Safety Profile:
- Retinopathy complications: 3.0% vs 1.8% (HR 1.76, p=0.02)
- Severe hypoglycemia: 2.4% vs 1.5%
- Pancreatitis: 0.3% vs 0.1%
- Gastrointestinal events: 39% vs 27%

Mechanistic Insights:
- Direct cardioprotective effects beyond glucose lowering
- Improved endothelial function and reduced inflammation
- Weight loss contributes to cardiovascular benefits

Regulatory Impact: Strengthened cardiovascular indication for GLP-1 class
Market Response: Increased adoption in high-risk diabetic patients
Cost-Effectiveness: $50,000-$75,000 per QALY in high-risk populations
